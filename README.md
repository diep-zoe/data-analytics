# Data Analytics with R

Code from my coursework in the Management Data Analytics Certificate program at the University of Mannheim

## Thysenkrupp Case
[Linear Regression, Univariate Analysis with data from Thysenkrupp Solutions Code](https://github.com/dieptn1610/data-analytics/blob/main/Thysenkrupp_Workshop%20Code.R)

## Singflower Case
Mark Li, the head of innovation of Singflower, suggested using drones to take pictures of the
flowers. With these pictures, Mark Li aims to train a model that detects which flowers are over/under/well watered before it is too late. 
If Mark Li succeeds in his purpose, he will be able to reduce the amount of dead iris.
This can trigger an increase in production at Singflower and/or the development of a new product.
